                    <h5>The Timline of HTML
1991- Tim Berners-Lee invents HTML 1.0 <br><br>
1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.<br><br>
1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.<br><br>
1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.<br><br>
1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.<br><br>
2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.<br><br>

                    <h6>Universal Accessibility:
HTML was designed to be platform-neutral, ensuring that web content could be viewed and accessed by anyone, regardless of their operating system or device.<br><br>
Structured Content:
It provides a basic set of tags and elements to define the structure and semantics of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and links, making content organized and machine-readable.<br><br>
Interconnectivity:
The core concept of hypertext enables linking between documents, forming a vast, interconnected network of information that facilitates easy navigation and discovery.<br><br>
Simplicity and Extensibility:
HTML was intended to be relatively easy to learn and use, while also being extensible enough to accommodate future needs and evolving web technologies.</h6>
